# MageOS_Seo

A comprehensive Magento 2 **SEO + AEO** module: JSON-LD structured data, Open Graph / Twitter meta, canonical & robots management, hreflang, sitemaps, and answer-engine identity (LocalBusiness / Article / Event / Speakable). Three modules build on it: [MageOS_Faq](https://github.com/mage-os-lab/module-faq) adds FAQ rich results, [MageOS_Aeo](https://github.com/mage-os-lab/module-aeo) the `/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt` and `/llms.jsonl` documents and AI-crawler robots directives, and [MageOS_Agentic](https://github.com/mage-os-lab/module-agentic) the `/.well-known/ucp` agentic commerce profile.

Every cross-cutting concern is built as an **extensible provider pool** — a second module contributes a provider through its own `di.xml` without ever editing this module.

---

## What it covers

- **SEO** — structured data, meta tags, canonicals, robots meta, pagination handling, hreflang.
- **AEO** (Answer Engine Optimisation) — LocalBusiness, Article, Event, Speakable, aggregate ratings, merchant policies, and the FAQ source pool that FAQ rich results draw on.
- **The shared layer its companion modules build on** — the rebuild queue and `seo:rebuild` command, the FAQ source pool, the Organization, the public-path registry, and the admin tab and ACL resource their settings sit under.

---

## Features

### Structured data (JSON-LD)

- Organization, WebSite, BreadcrumbList, CollectionPage, and per-product schemas output as `<script type="application/ld+json">` in `<head>`, all cross-referenced by a shared `@id`.
- **16 product schema templates** — GenericProduct, Food, Apparel, Jewelry, HomeDecor, Book, Software, Toy, HealthProduct, Cosmetics, Pet, ArtAndCraft, ElectronicsSimple, Tool, Stationery, LocalExperience.
- **Configurable products as a ProductGroup** — each sellable child a variant with its own offer, `variesBy` from the product's own configurable attributes, variant URLs that preselect the options; above a configurable limit, one **AggregateOffer** (lowPrice/highPrice) over the children's prices.
- **Aggregate ratings** — a priority pool with a native Magento reviews provider built in; review vendors (Yotpo, Trustpilot, …) plug in a higher-priority provider.
- **Merchant policies** — shipping details, return policy, and item condition merged into product offers via an offer-enricher pool (required for Google Merchant free listings).

### Meta & crawl control

- **Open Graph + Twitter** — og:title/description/image/type/site_name/locale on product, category, and site pages, and the matching X card tags: `summary_large_image` or `summary` by whether the page has an image, with the title, description and image repeated as `twitter:*`.
- **Canonical URL management** — automatic canonicals on product, category, CMS, and home pages; deduplicates if one is already present.
- **Robots meta pool** — global INDEX/FOLLOW defaults for product, category, **and CMS** pages, overridable per category/product, plus a pagination provider for `?p=N` pages and enriched directives (`max-snippet`, `max-image-preview`, `noarchive`, `noai`, …).

### Multistore

- **hreflang** — `<head>` alternate links, and the same alternates inline in `sitemap.xml`, with language-only and x-default handling. Resolvers are a pool (product/category/CMS built in; vendor/blog pages plug in).

### Answer-engine (AEO)

- **FAQ source pool** — `FaqSourceProviderInterface` sources (empty by default) that MageOS_Aeo's llms documents read their FAQ groups from. [MageOS_Faq](https://github.com/mage-os-lab/module-faq) registers its FAQ table here, and adds the FAQ Manager, widget, Page Builder content type and FAQPage JSON-LD.
- **LocalBusiness** — address, telephone and email on every organisation type; geo coordinates and price range for local businesses.
- **Article / Event / Speakable** — bridge pools (empty by default) fed by blog/event modules, plus a configurable Speakable selector set.

### Translations

- **en_US** (the source), **en_GB** and **nl_NL**. The admin follows the admin user's locale. See [docs/translations.md](docs/translations.md).

## Requirements

- PHP 8.3 – 8.5
- Magento Open Source / Mage-OS **2.4.7 or newer** (`magento/framework
  ^103.0.7`), including 2.4.9 on PHP 8.5. The module runs unmodified across the
  whole range and carries no version polyfills: 2.4.7 is the first release with
  `Magento\Framework\ObjectManager\ResetAfterRequestInterface`, which the
  request-scoped services implement directly.
- Magento MSI (`Inventory*`) modules — a hard dependency: product availability
  is resolved through the MSI service contracts.

## Installation

```bash
composer require mage-os/module-seo
bin/magento module:enable MageOS_Seo
bin/magento setup:upgrade
bin/magento cache:flush
```

---

## Important: configure Organisation before going live

> **The module works immediately after install, but structured data and the Organisation JSON-LD node will be empty until you fill in the Organisation details** (and so will MageOS_Aeo's `/llms.txt`, when installed).

Go to **Marketing > SEO > Organization** and complete all fields before putting the site live.

| Field | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| Name | Your organisation's display name (falls back to store name in llms.txt if blank) |
| URL | Canonical URL of your organisation (e.g. `https://example.com`) |
| Description | Short tagline — shown in JSON-LD and at the top of `/llms.txt` |
| Organisation type | Schema.org `@type`: Organization, Corporation, NGO, etc. |
| Logo | The theme's header logo, or an uploaded image |
| Logo width / height | Pixel dimensions — required for valid Organization schema |
| Social profiles | Social profile URLs (Twitter, LinkedIn, etc.) |
| Contact point | contactType, email, availableLanguage for the ContactPoint node |
| Local presence | Address, geo coordinates, telephone, email, price range (LocalBusiness AEO) |

Without a Name and URL saved, the Organization node in JSON-LD will render with empty values, which search engines and validators will flag as invalid.

---

## Admin configuration

**Stores > Configuration > MageOS SEO** holds two sections. MageOS_Aeo, when installed, adds AI Information & Crawlers, and MageOS_Agentic adds Agentic Commerce (UCP).

### SEO Configuration (`mageos_seo_general`)

| Group | Key settings | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Open Graph Tags | Enable OG/Twitter tags | Yes |
| Structured Data (JSON-LD) | Master switch, default product template, ItemList toggle & max, most variants per configurable product, aggregate rating | Yes / GenericProduct |
| Canonical URLs | Canonical link on CMS pages and the home page | Yes |
| Robots Meta | Product / category / **CMS** / search results defaults, pagination policy | *(empty — Magento default applies)* |
| Hreflang | Enable, language-only, sitemap | Yes |
| Answer Engine (AEO) | Speakable toggle + CSS selectors | No |

### SEO Merchant Policies (`mageos_seo_merchant`)

| Group | Purpose | Default |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Item Condition | Default schema.org itemCondition on offers | NewCondition |
| Return Policy | `hasMerchantReturnPolicy` on offers | Off |
| Shipping Details | `OfferShippingDetails` on offers | Off |

---

## Per-category & per-product SEO

In the **category** edit form, an **SEO (Structured Data)** fieldset adds: schema template, enabled optional fields, field overrides, ItemList toggle, and robots meta. Template/field settings inherit from ancestor categories when unset.

In the **product** edit form, an **Advanced SEO** tab adds store-specific field overrides and a robots-meta override.

---

## FAQ rich results

FAQs, their admin, the widget, the Page Builder content type and the FAQPage JSON-LD are in [MageOS_Faq](https://github.com/mage-os-lab/module-faq). This module keeps the FAQ source pool it registers with.

---

## AI discoverability

`/llms.txt`, `/llms-full.txt`, `/llms.jsonl` and the AI-crawler directives in `robots.txt` are in [MageOS_Aeo](https://github.com/mage-os-lab/module-aeo). This module keeps the rebuild queue they are built through, and the Organization, locale and FAQ sources they describe.

---

## Product schema templates

Each template maps to a `ProductSchemaBuilderInterface` implementation. Every template emits a
`schema.org/Product` node (Google's Product rich results and merchant listings require the
Product type); templates for creative works add a secondary type alongside Product, and
category-specific data with no valid Product property is expressed via `additionalProperty`:

| Code | Label | Schema type |
| --- | --- | --- |
| GenericProduct | Generic Product | Product |
| Food | Food & Grocery | Product |
| Apparel | Clothing & Apparel | Product |
| Jewelry | Jewelry | Product |
| HomeDecor | Home Decor & Furniture | Product |
| Book | Books | Product + Book |
| Software | Software & Apps | Product + SoftwareApplication |
| Toy | Toys & Games | Product |
| HealthProduct | Health & Wellness | Product |
| Cosmetics | Beauty & Cosmetics | Product |
| Pet | Pet Supplies | Product |
| ArtAndCraft | Art & Craft | Product + VisualArtwork |
| ElectronicsSimple | Electronics | Product |
| Tool | Tools & Hardware | Product |
| Stationery | Stationery & Office | Product |
| LocalExperience | Local Experience | Product |

The default template (`GenericProduct`) is used when no template is configured for the product's category. Change it under **Stores > Configuration > MageOS SEO > SEO > Structured Data (JSON-LD) > Default Product Schema Template**.

---

## Extending the module

Every cross-cutting concern is a provider pool wired via `di.xml`, so another module contributes a provider from its **own** `di.xml` without modifying this one. Most provider interfaces expose `getHandles()` (`['*']` = all pages) for layout-handle scoping; resolution is *collect-all*, *one winner* (highest sortOrder or priority), or *a lookup by key* (template code, path segment, group name).

| Extension point | Interface | Resolution |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Structured data providers | `StructuredDataProviderInterface` | collect-all |
| Meta tag providers | `MetaTagProviderInterface` | collect-all |
| Page title providers | `PageTitleProviderInterface` | highest sortOrder with a title wins |
| Product schema builders | `ProductSchemaBuilderInterface` | by template code |
| Robots meta providers | `RobotsMetaProviderInterface` | highest sortOrder with a value wins |
| Aggregate rating providers | `AggregateRatingProviderInterface` | highest-priority non-null |
| Offer enrichers | `OfferEnricherInterface` | collect-all (merged into every product and variant offer) |
| Variant URLs | `ProductVariantUrlResolverInterface` | one (di.xml preference) |
| Hreflang resolvers | `HreflangResolverInterface` | collect-all |
| Article / Event data providers | `ArticleDataProviderInterface` / `EventDataProviderInterface` | collect-all |
| FAQ source providers | `FaqSourceProviderInterface` | collect-all |
| Rebuild queue groups | `Api\Rebuild\GroupHandlerInterface` | by group name ([docs/extending.md](docs/extending.md#rebuilding-your-own-output-through-the-queue)) |
| Public documents (no session) | `Model\Router\PublicPaths` (di.xml `paths` / `prefixes`) | lookup by path |

Example — add a robots-meta provider for blog pages from your module's `di.xml`:

```xml
<type name="MageOS\Seo\Model\RobotsMeta\Resolver">
    <arguments>
        <argument name="providers" xsi:type="array">
            <item name="blog" xsi:type="object">Vendor\Blog\Model\BlogRobotsProvider</item>
        </argument>
    </arguments>
</type>
```

## Development

```bash
composer install

# Run all quality gates
composer test

# Or individually
vendor/bin/phpunit -c phpunit.xml.dist --testsuite unit
vendor/bin/phpstan analyse --memory-limit=1G
vendor/bin/php-cs-fixer fix --dry-run --diff --allow-risky=yes
vendor/bin/phpcs --standard=phpcs.xml.dist
XDEBUG_MODE=coverage vendor/bin/infection --threads=4  # gate: minMsi in infection.json5
```

Integration tests live under `Test/Integration/` and run in CI against a live Magento install via [`graycoreio/github-actions-magento2`](https://github.com/graycoreio/github-actions-magento2). They cannot be run locally without a full Magento installation.
